This Power Bi Dashboard studies data from Datacamp Atlas Lab, specific keys about this project are:

-  Data load and initial exploratory data analysis on general HR(Human Resources) trends. 

-  Extract insights using DAX and build custom visuals base on the goal : "Atlas Labs wants answers on its employee demographics and performance".

-  Creation of a user-friendly, clean, and branded experience. Dashboard and graphics were created with the same color that DataCamp logo, navigation tools and custom text fonts in dashboard.
